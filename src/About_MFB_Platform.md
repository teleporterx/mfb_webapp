3. **Integration with APIs:**

    To fetch **real-time information**, fund data, and NAVs (Net Asset Values), the platform integrates with external APIs such as the **RapidAPI** marketplace to retrieve data about mutual funds.
    The RapidAPI integration provides a streamlined way to fetch updated mutual fund NAVs, allowing users to make informed decisions about their investments.
